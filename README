## Starting up NATS server and connecting to it for publishing/subscribing messages

#### Server
CAM dev boxes already have an instance of nats running from `/usr/bin/gnatsd` with config
found in `/etc/gnatsd.conf`.

#### Client
Various client apps can be downloaded from https://nats.io/download/ and for this example
we use this client https://github.com/3kwa/goingnats to connect to our local NATS server
to do basic publication and subscription for messages.
